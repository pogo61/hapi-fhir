/**
 * Works like the normal {@link ca.uhn.fhir.rest.server.IncomingRequestAddressStrategy} unless there's an
 * x-forwarded-host present, in which case that's used in place of the server's address.
 *
 * If the Apache Http Server <i>mod_proxy</i> isn't configured to supply <i>x-forwarded-proto</i>, the factory method that you use
 * to create the address strategy will determine the default. Note that <i>mod_proxy</i> doesn't set this by default, but it can be
 * configured via <i>RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Proto http</i> (or https)
 *
 * If you want to set the protocol based on something other than the constructor argument, you should be able to do so
 * by overriding <i>protocol</i>.
 *
 * Note that while this strategy was designed to work with Apache Http Server, and has been tested against it, it should work with
 * any proxy server that sets <i>x-forwarded-host</i>
